Production
==========

This repository holds the Java source code for the current BioTapestry production release (now at 7.1.1).

Note: To compile the source code, you will need flexjson-2.1.jar and servlet-api.jar in your classpath.
However, those jars are not needed to run BioTapestry as a Java desktop application.
