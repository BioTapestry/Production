Production
==========

With active BioTapestry development going into hibernation, this repository holds the current development Java source code. 
This branch is unstable, and not recommended for anything but development use. 

Note: To compile the source code, you will need flexjson-2.1.jar and servlet-api.jar in your classpath.
However, those jars are not needed to run BioTapestry as a Java desktop application.
